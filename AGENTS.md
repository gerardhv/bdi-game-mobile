# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository. Human-facing docs are in Dutch under `docs/`; this file is the technical entry point for agents.

## What this is

An educational multiplayer platform for BDI teaching games. Games share one skeleton (host beamer + phones, claim/ready, without→with BDI, policy on every read). The first pack is the logistics chain (`gameId: logistics`): four roles `buyer`, `seller`, `carrier`, `delivery`. All organisations and data are fictional.

Read before changing behaviour:

- `docs/gameplay.md` / `docs/games/`: packs and the logistics script (S00–S20, traffic jam).
- `docs/games/README.md`: how to add a game pack.
- `docs/bdi-model.md`: what BDI means in this game (membership ≠ read right, policy checked on every read).
- `docs/architecture.md`: storage, realtime, clock, identity, engine vs packs.
- `docs/design-decisions.md`: deliberate deviations from the spec. Add new ones here.
- `docs/remake-prompt.md`: the original functional spec (Dutch). It is gitignored, so it may be absent; if present it is leading for game rules.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:api        # API on :8787 (tsx watch)
npm run dev            # web on :5173, proxies /api and /health to :8787
npm run typecheck      # domain, API and web
npm test               # Vitest: packages/**/*.test.ts, services/**/*.test.ts
npm run test:e2e       # Playwright, ~6 min, starts API and web itself
npm run check:bundle   # build web and fail on secrets in the bundle
```

The shell on the maintainer's machine is PowerShell on Windows. Nothing loads `.env` files; set env vars in the shell (`$env:NAME = "value"`). All variables are listed in `.env.example`.

Definition of done for a change: `npm run typecheck` and `npm test` pass. Run `npm run test:e2e` when you touch game flow, the host screen, the phone screen or anything with a `data-testid`. Update the Dutch docs in `docs/` when behaviour, configuration or deployment changes.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `packages/domain` | Engine + game packs. Pure TypeScript, no I/O. Imported as `@bdi/domain` (source, no build step). |
| `services/game-api` | Hono HTTP server on Node. Auth, persistence, SSE, 500 ms tick loop. |
| `apps/web` | React 19 + Vite SPA with a hash router. Shell in `src/host` / `src/phone`; pack UI in `src/games/<id>`. |
| `e2e` | Playwright acceptance tests; one browser context per role. |
| `scripts` | Local helpers (`seed-session.mjs`, `open-sessions.mjs`, `check-bundle.mjs`). |
| `supabase` | Local Supabase config and the `session_documents` migration. |
| `render.yaml`, `vercel.json` | Cloud config: API on Render, web on Vercel. See `docs/deployment.md`. |

### Domain (`packages/domain/src`)

- `types.ts`: `SessionState` (includes `gameId`), `RoundState`, `GameError`; `OrgId`/`StepId` are strings.
- `catalog.ts` / `game-definition.ts`: registered packs; `getGame`, `listGames`.
- `games/logistics/`: logistics content (`scenario`, `steps`, `policy`, `definition`); public API re-exports these from `index.ts`.
- `dispatch.ts`: `dispatch(session, command, ctx)` is the single reducer; `createSession` takes `gameId`.
- `project.ts`: BDI pipeline (publish → outbox → notify → fetch), knowledge panels, frames.
- `views.ts`: `trainingView` (host only) and `playerView` (one role). These are the only shapes that leave the server.

### API (`services/game-api/src`)

- `index.ts`: boot, optional Postgres, `setInterval(tickAll, 500)`.
- `app.ts`: routes. Every mutating route maps to exactly one domain `Command`.
- `service.ts`: `MemoryStore` (serialized `run()` transactions on cloned documents), dev-token signing, Supabase token check, `GameService`.
- `postgres.ts`: loads all sessions at boot; `MemoryStore` upserts via debounced `onFlush` (`PERSIST_INTERVAL_MS`, immediate for new/closed) and deletes via `onDelete` after idle/expiry close.

## Invariants — do not break these

1. **The domain is deterministic.** No `Date.now()`, `new Date()`, `Math.random()`, `randomUUID()` or `process.env` inside `packages/domain` (the default argument in `trainingView` is the only exception). Time comes from `ctx.now`; ids and seeds are generated in the API and passed in the command. Shuffling uses `shuffle(items, seed)`.
2. **`dispatch` returns a new state.** It `structuredClone`s the input; never mutate a session outside `store.run()`.
3. **Identity comes from the token, never from the body.** Routes set `userId` from `userFromAuth(...)`. Build commands field by field; do not spread `c.req.json()` into a command.
4. **No answer leaks to players.** `playerView` exposes only the player's own sources and, in the BDI round, authorized received data. Never add `scenarioSeed`, expected values or other roles' sources to a player view. `trainingView` is host-only (checked in `GameService.training`) and must not expose invite tokens of claimed roles.
5. **BDI rules live in the active pack’s policy (today `games/logistics/policy.ts`).** Every read goes through `authorize` at the source; being a member or having a transport role is not a read right. Notifications carry minimal metadata; payloads are fetched separately.
6. **Server time drives everything.** The client animates from `phaseEnteredAt`, `dueAt` and `serverNow`; it never advances the game itself. Pausing shifts all deadlines so pause time is not counted as decision time.
7. **One API instance.** Memory is the source of truth; Postgres is a write-behind copy loaded at boot. Do not introduce designs that assume multiple instances or serverless functions without redesigning storage first.
8. **Secrets stay server-side.** Only `VITE_*` variables reach the browser. Never put `AUTH_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_TICK_SECRET` or a Supabase `service_role` key in a `VITE_*` variable; `check:bundle` guards this.

## Common changes

**New player or host action**

1. Add a variant to `Command` in `dispatch.ts`, a `case` in `dispatch`, and a handler function.
2. Decide whether it is allowed while paused (list at the top of `dispatch`).
3. Add a route in `app.ts` that sets `type` and `userId` itself and picks body fields explicitly.
4. Call it from the web app through `api(...)` in `apps/web/src/api.ts`.
5. Add a domain test in `round.test.ts` (and an API test in `app.test.ts` for auth or isolation rules).

**Changing what a screen shows**

The web app does not import `@bdi/domain`. Its view types in `apps/web/src/types.ts` are a hand-maintained mirror of `TrainingView` and `PlayerView` in `views.ts`. Change both, then run `npm run typecheck`.

**Changing step flow or scenario data**

Edit `steps.ts` and `scenario.ts`. Check `nextStepId`, `STEP_ACTOR`, `COARSE`, `CONFIRM`/`CHOOSE`, and the mirrored `CONFIRM_STEPS` in `apps/web/src/types.ts`. The e2e helper plays by trying options per role, so it survives answer reshuffles, but it relies on test ids.

**Text and language**

Both Dutch (`nl`, default) and English (`en`) are required.

- Domain and server text: `t(language, nl, en)` or `{ nl, en }` records in `scenario.ts`/`steps.ts`.
- UI text: `apps/web/src/i18n.ts`. The `en` object is typed as `typeof nl`, so a missing key is a type error.
- Error messages in `GameError` are Dutch and shown to users.

**Environment variable**

Read it in the API (`service.ts` or `index.ts`), never in the domain; pass values via `Ctx` if the domain needs them. Add it to `.env.example`, to `render.yaml` if it is needed in the cloud, and to `docs/local.md` or `docs/deployment.md`.

## Testing notes

- Domain tests build a session with `createSession` + `claimRole`/`markReady` for all four orgs and drive it with `dispatch`, advancing `ctx.now` by hand. Follow that pattern; do not use fake timers.
- API tests use `createApp(new MemoryStore())` and `app.request(...)` with dev tokens from `/api/dev/anonymous`. Without `GAME_FILE` the store stays in memory.
- E2E tests locate elements by `data-testid` (for example `start-session`, `session-code`, `free-<org>`, `claim-role`, `phone-<org>`, `ready`). Keep existing test ids stable when refactoring UI. `E2E_VERBOSE=1` logs every tick.
- Layout requirements covered by e2e: the host screen at 1920×1080 must not scroll; phones (360×640, 390×844, 430×932) must not scroll horizontally.
- Only the host screen plays sound (`apps/web/src/sound.ts`); phones stay silent.

## Code style

- TypeScript strict, ES modules. Inside `packages/domain` and `services/game-api`, relative imports use the `.js` extension (`./types.js`).
- No semicolons, single quotes, two-space indent, trailing commas in multiline literals. Match the surrounding file; there is no formatter or linter configured.
- Code, identifiers and comments in English; user-facing text bilingual as above; docs in `docs/` in Dutch.
- Comments only for constraints the code cannot show. No narrating comments.
- Keep dependencies minimal. Prefer the platform and existing libraries (Hono, React Router, `pg`, `qrcode`).

## Should have — keep runtime efficient

Correctness invariants above are musts. These are **shoulds** for changes to the API, persistence, realtime, ticks, or cloud config: avoid unnecessary network, CPU, and storage work. Wasteful loops (for example writing the full session to Postgres on every tick) burn bandwidth and money on any plan and can take the service down when quotas are hit.

1. **Do not chat with the database or network for free.** Postgres is a write-behind copy. Never write the full session document on every tick, heartbeat, or no-op. Persist via debounced `onFlush` (`PERSIST_INTERVAL_MS`); flush immediately only for new or closed sessions (and on process shutdown).
2. **Idle must be cheap.** An open `lobby` / `paused` / abandoned session with nobody playing must not generate steady network, CPU, or DB write load. Skip remote persist when state is unchanged. Idle sessions close after `SESSION_IDLE_MS` (default 30 min without commands/heartbeats) and are deleted from memory and Postgres; keep that behaviour.
3. **Batch and debounce side effects.** Periodic loops (tick, health, cleanup) may run often in memory; side effects that leave the process (DB upserts, external HTTP, large logs) should be rare relative to the loop.
4. **No keep-alive by hammering the network.** No self-fetch loops, dispatcher spam, or chatty probes just to avoid host sleep unless the user explicitly asks.
5. **Prefer in-memory truth.** Do not add per-tick analytics, audit rows, or chatty third-party calls unless required for the game.
6. **When in doubt, estimate.** Before adding a `setInterval`, flush, or external call: rough bytes × frequency × open sessions. If that can reach hundreds of MB/hour with one forgotten session, redesign before merging.
7. **Document cost- or load-relevant behaviour** in `docs/architecture.md` / `docs/design-decisions.md` when you change persistence, ticks, or hosting assumptions.

## Out of scope unless asked

- The ideas list at the end of the spec is explicitly not to be built.
- No connections to real BDI registries, identity providers or organisations.
- No per-entity relational schema; sessions stay one JSON document.
